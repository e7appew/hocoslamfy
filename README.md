hocoslamfy

You are a small bee and you must fly to avoid the bamboo shoots!

This game requires SDL 2.0, SDL-image 2.0, SDL-mixer 2.0 and a C compiler. It is optimised for low-resolution screens.

Everything's under the GPL version 2.

To compile this for PC, use `make clean; make` on a PC with SDL, SDL-image and SDL-mixer 1.2. You'll then get a windowed SDL game.

To compile this for OpenDingux, use `make TARGET=hocoslamfy-od clean; make TARGET=hocoslamfy-od opk` on a PC with the `PATH` set to include your OpenDingux mipsel toolchain.
